              My Story
         </h2>
          <div class="content">
						I grew up in Glendale Arizona, majored in Film at Arizona State University and now I'm a 
						software developer living in Brooklyn. My dad got me into computer technology and coding
						at a young age, teaching me basic HTML and CSS. Enough to make a simple homepage with 
						bookmarks to my favorite sites, you know, various sparkling GeoCities pages, HOTBOT search
						engine and my Juno email. 

						In college I found myself saddled with a new found passion for film and ended up with a degree
						in Film and Media. However, life has a crazy way of getting you to suddenly move to Brooklyn.
						It was here that my obsession with technology and web development took hold. I studied the basics using
						the wide variety of online resources (Khan Academy, Coursera, Udacity etc.) and eventually landed a 
						spot at Fullstack academy of code (around a 5% acceptance rate at the time I got in FYI).

						After Fullstack I quickly got my first professional software development job where I stayed for over
						two years. It was at a very small company so I was imedieatly given some subtantial responsibiities.
						I taught myself Java, SQL, and Spring well enough to eventually become the lead software developer
						there. However, as much as I learned I knew I had reached a plateau and am currently on the look out 
						for a new company where I can grow substantially as a developer.
