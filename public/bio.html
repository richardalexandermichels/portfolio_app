         </h2>
          <div class="content">
			I am a relative newcomer to software development who has 
			attained a position in the field driven by my passion 
			for technology. My journey has taken me from earning a BA 
			in Film to working at Yellowstone National Park, to delivering 
			coffee in Manhattan, to attending Fullstack Academy of Code in NYC
			and eventually being hired as a full time developer. In my current 
			position I work autonomously and independently
			across the stack supporting existing application deployments 
			and implementing new custom features. I am currently looking to 
			join and learn from a strong core of diverse engineers. 
			I believe the next step in my journey is to gain as much knowledge 
			as possible from an experienced mentor and offer my own dedicated
			work ethic.
