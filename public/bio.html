              My Story
         </h2>
          <div class="content">
						I grew up in Glendale Arizona, majored in film studies at Arizona State University and now I'm a 
						software developer living in Brooklyn. My dad got me into computer and basic web technology
						at a young age, teaching HTML and CSS. Enough to make a simple homepage with 
						bookmarks to my favorite sites.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						In college I found myself saddled with a new found passion for film and ended up with a degree
						in Film and Media Studies. However, life has a crazy way of getting you to suddenly move to Brooklyn.
						It was here that my obsession with technology and web development was refreshed. I studied 
						using a wide variety of online resources (Khan Academy, Coursera, Udacity etc.) and eventually landed a 
						spot at Fullstack academy of code. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						After Fullstack I quickly got my first professional software development job where I stayed for over
						3 years. It was at a very small company so I was imedieatly given some subtantial responsibiities.
						I was able to learn Java, SQL, and Spring well enough to eventually become the lead software developer
						there. However, as much as I learned I knew I had reached a plateau and am currently on the look out 
						for a new company where I can further my career.
