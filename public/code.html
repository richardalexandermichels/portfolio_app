              A Personal Website Using VanillaJS
          </h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              I've built applications using a very wide variety of frameworking technologies from Spring to Angular. But with my personal site I have a few specific goals in mind that I'd like to accomplish using just as much plain JavaScript as I can.
            </p>

              <ol style='margin-left: 20px'>
                <li>
                  Light weight. I'd like as little overhead as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Learn responsive design outside of framework
                </li>
              </ol>

            <p>
              The first goal is established immediately, I have little to worry about in terms of boiler 
              plate code, various framework versions and other issues. The second goal is much more 
              interesting to me as I learned web application design from the framework side. At Fullstack 
              we did some minor projects creating sites from scratch but I wanted to take a deeper dive 
              into understanding and building a responsive web application using only vanilla JavaScript. 
              I believe that understanding the fundamentals will help me levarage all of the dynamic latent 
              JavaScript features when I am doing more robust application devlopment using a front end framework.

                This is an implementation of a depth first search based maze generation and solving algorithms using backtracking. It is
                a logically fairly simple approach that was a lot of fun to implement in code. What struck me as most interesting was creating
                the maze solving algorithm. While it is largely identical to the generation, I found with a couple simple changes to the
                canvas (e.g. removing grid lines, changing colors and size of solved path) ended up creating rather striking procedurally
                generated art. And that is a perfect example of how I fell in love with coding. Itâ€™s not the intent behind the code that
                fascinates me, but the kinds of emergent behaviors that inevitably arrive during the process of development and actually
                usage of the program.

              This is a basic implementation of the classic cellular automata Conway's Game Of Life. One of the very first things we did
              at Fullstack was create a Game of Life using CSS and Javascript. I love emergent behavior and procedural generation and the
              beautiful way that manifest in this execution of a simple rule set. This version is designed using a canvas element and pure
              Javascript. This version attempts to create mirrored edges so the cells can propagate from one edge back to the opposite.
              However, this aspect is still under heavy development.
