            Story
          </h3>
          <div class="content">
                        I am a relative newcomer to software development who has 
attained a position in the field driven by my passion 
for technology. My journey has taken me from earning a BA 
in Film to working at Yellowstone National Park, to delivering 
coffee in Manhattan, to attending Fullstack Academy of Code in NYC
and eventually being hired as a full time developer. In my current 
position I work autonomously and independently
across the stack supporting existing application deployments 
and implementing new custom features. I am currently looking to 
join and learn from a strong core of diverse engineers. 
I believe the next step in my journey is to gain as much knowledge 
as possible from an experienced mentor and offer my own dedicated
work ethic.
