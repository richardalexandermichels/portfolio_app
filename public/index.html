              I am a full stack web application developer currently residing in Brooklyn, NY. I love
              learning new things and obsess over functionality and usability. I have over two years
              of professional software development experience which includes a wide range of responsibilities.
              I've worked largely within the financial sphere developing software solutions for money management
              firms. I was responsible for multiple drastic overhauls in UI and UX design, along side multiple
              custom development projects designed on a per client basis. I learned the fundamentals of web
              development in NYC at Fullstack Academy, a highly competitive and top ranked coding bootcamp.
